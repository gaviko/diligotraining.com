A web app that produces Standard Operating Procedures for various industries in Namibia e.g. a SOP for using a specific printing press or storing, handling and 
preparing sushi - hygienically. I custom wiki that produces easily downloadable pdfs.

Training in Namibia is quite costly and training material very difficult to get. DiligoTraining.com should be an easy to use web app for creating, editing,
and downloading SOPs peer reviewed by Namibian industry specialists. 

I would like to use Python, Django framework. 

I am obviously a noob, so any assistance or advice will be appreciated.
